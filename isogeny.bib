Although the isomorphism between a given supersingular curve and its quadratic twist is not defined over {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}p^2{\}}{\$}{\$}Fp2in general, restricting operations to the x-lines of both sets of twists allows all arithmetic to be carried out over {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}p^2{\}}{\$}{\$}Fp2as usual. Furthermore, since supersingular twists always have the same {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}F{\}}{\_}{\{}p^2{\}}{\$}{\$}Fp2-rational j-invariant, the SIDH protocol remains unchanged when Alice and Bob are free to work in both sets of twists.",

abstract="In this paper, we investigate the problem of constructing postquantum-secure verifiable delay functions (VDFs), particularly based on supersingular isogenies. Isogeny-based VDF constructions have been proposed before, but since verification relies on pairings, they are broken by quantum computers. We propose an entirely different approach using succinct non-interactive arguments (SNARGs), but specifically tailored to the arithmetic structure of the isogeny setting to achieve good asymptotic efficiency. We obtain an isogeny-based VDF construction with postquantum security, quasi-logarithmic verification, and requiring no trusted setup. As a building block, we also construct non-interactive arguments for isogeny walks in the supersingular graph over {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb F{\_}{\{}p^2{\}}{\$}{\$}Fp2, which may be of independent interest.",
